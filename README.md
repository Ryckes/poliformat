PoliformaT
----------

This is the code of a Chrome extension aimed at enhancing the use of
UPV (Universitat Politécnica de València)'s virtual campus. It
provides a (poorly designed) graphical interface for navigating the
user's courses' folders and downloading files.

Login
-----

There is the option to store login credentials in the extension. Be
warned that none of this data is encrypted or hashed and will probably
be stored as plain text by Chrome.

If you were to store your credentials using the aforementioned
feature, the extension will attempt to log in periodically (unless it
detects you are already logged in) to keep you identified in
PoliformaT (and thus, the whole UPV network) all the time. I find this
very useful, since I no longer have to log in everytime I have to look
up something or download a file in PoliformaT.

Improvements
------------

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you feel any of the
features doesn't work as intended.

I am uploading the code to Github so anyone can improve upon it or use
the code for their own purposes (mind the license). After June 2016 I
won't be maintaining this code anymore.
